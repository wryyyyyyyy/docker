    One hint on working with the \( \) back-reference operators
-- this is a god-awful ugly syntax and makes it twice as hard to
understand a complicated expression.  When I'm designing a complicated
pattern on paper using back-refs, I leave out the \( \) and simply
underline each section I want to back-reference (some sections will
have multiple underlines if you nest the back-refs).  Sometimes I'll
even number the underlines with subscripts, and use a "2" with a circle
around it vs the "\2" notation for the other part.  This makes things
so much easier to understand, and I'd recommend you do the same when
writing complicated REs, or as a first step when trying to reverse-
engineer someone else's RE.  :-)  Only put in the \(\)s as a final step.
Also, be sure to write out a typical example of what the pattern space
looks like, including the lookup table, immediately above the expression
you're working on.  I'll sometimes put this in a sed comment right next
to the expression.
